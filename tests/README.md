## Unit tests
We try to practice TDD during development so here you will find unit tests that were used to develop the platform and perhaps better understand how it works inside.

To create new unit tests you can copy "example" folder and modify the files inside. We use popular Catch2 unit test framework, so you might need to read its [README](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2?tab=readme-ov-file#what-is-catch2) first.
